IntelliJ IDEA.

To set up your code editor, please follow the official instructions available at https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor. 

5. Clone repository

To run the project, clone this repository https://github.com/kjacmenja21/indoorlocalization_mobile_app to your computer.

6. Run project (Visual Studio Code)

In the root directory of the repository, you will see a file il_app_project.code-workspace. This is a Visual Studio Code Workspace file (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) and you can open the project with this file.

Next, in the il_app project, find and open the file main.dart. This file is an entry point to the Flutter application. Once this file is open, you will be able to easily run the project. Also, donâ€™t forget to prepare your physical or virtual Android device.

If needed, run the command flutter pub get in il_app to fetch all dependent packages.
